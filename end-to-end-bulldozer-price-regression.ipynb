    "# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I go through a machine learning projeect with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition \n",
    "> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "the data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the goal is to build an ML model that minimizes RMSLE\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features \n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset\n",
